# KESE Secure Coding Prompt Generator

Generate secure coding prompts based on KISA guidelines and international standards (OWASP, CWE).

## Guideline Selection

| # | Guideline | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **CII Secure Coding** | Traditional vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.) |
| 2 | **AI Security Coding** | AI-specific (Prompt Injection, Data Poisoning, etc.) |

## CII Branch

Reference `references/cii/webapp.md` for CWE-based patterns. Generate language-specific prompts (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, etc.) and function-specific prompts (auth, file upload, API security).

## AI Security Branch

Reference `references/ai-security/developer.md` and `references/ai-security/overview.md`. Generate prompts for: Prompt Injection defense, Data Poisoning prevention, Model Extraction protection, LLM security, RAG pipeline security.

## Usage

Copy the generated prompt into your AI assistant conversation, then request code.
